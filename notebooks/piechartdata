We start by taking the dataframe and adding a grouping for same day meetings for the child and create a column for it called VISIT_ID. 
There are 9,543 total visits in the dataframe. When you do a count of just covisits, there are 4,091.  For IFSP Meeting there are 4891, and for IEP Meeting there are 632.  
This equates to 50.5% of the total for IFSP Meeting, 42.9% for Co-Visits, and 6.6% for IEP Meetings.
Next, we took the dataframe and pulled out VISIT_ID where there was only one instance of it, meaning only one visit for that child on that day. 
This left a value of 8,421 meetings.  Of this, 3,039 were Co-Visits, 4,755 were IFSP Meeting, and 627 were IEP meetings.  
For the total Single Covisits out of the total Co-Visits, it is 3,039/4,091, which is 74.3% of all Co-Visits.
